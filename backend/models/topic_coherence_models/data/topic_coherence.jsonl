{"text": "Question: What is backpressure?\nSentence: Backpressure is a flow control mechanism in streaming systems where downstream components signal upstream components to slow down when they cannot keep up with the data rate.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is backpressure?\nSentence: Flow control is a mechanism that manages the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Question: What is time complexity?\nSentence: Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time an algorithm takes as a function of the input size, typically expressed using Big O notation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Question: What is lazy loading?\nSentence: Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers the initialization or loading of resources until they are actually needed, improving initial load times and resource efficiency.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is lazy loading?\nSentence: Eager loading is a strategy that preloads related data or resources in advance to minimize the number of subsequent database queries.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Question: What is two-phase commit?\nSentence: Two-phase commit is a distributed transaction protocol that ensures all participating nodes either commit or abort a transaction, maintaining atomicity across multiple databases.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is two-phase commit?\nSentence: Three-phase commit is an extension of two-phase commit that adds an additional phase to reduce blocking in the presence of network partitions.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Question: What is a reverse proxy?\nSentence: A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server, often providing load balancing and security benefits.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is a reverse proxy?\nSentence: A forward proxy acts on behalf of clients, forwarding their requests to external servers while potentially providing anonymity or caching.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Question: What is ARP?\nSentence: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol that maps IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network segment.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Question: What is referential integrity?\nSentence: Referential integrity is a database constraint that ensures relationships between tables remain consistent by requiring foreign keys to reference valid primary keys.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is referential integrity?\nSentence: Domain integrity ensures that column values fall within a defined set of valid values or constraints.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Question: What is connection pooling?\nSentence: Connection pooling is a technique that maintains a cache of database connections that can be reused, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Question: What is connection pooling?\nSentence: Thread pooling manages a collection of reusable threads to handle tasks, avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently.", "label": 0}
